our route optimization system to estimate and minimize vehicle emissions for each route, provide real-time optimal routes, and ensure the system is user-friendly and accessible. Let's update our existing code to incorporate these features.

Let's update our React project to include these features:

```typescriptreact project="route-optimization"
...
```

These updates enhance our route optimization system with the following features:

1. Multiple route options: The system now provides several route alternatives, allowing users to choose the most suitable one.
2. Emissions calculation: Each route option includes an estimated CO2 emission, helping users make environmentally conscious decisions.
3. Real-time data: The system fetches current traffic and weather data to provide up-to-date information.
4. User-friendly interface: The updated UI clearly displays multiple route options, allowing users to easily compare and select routes.
5. Accessibility: The layout is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. We've also included proper labeling for screen readers.
6. Detailed emissions data: Each route option shows the estimated CO2 emissions, allowing users to compare the environmental impact of different routes.


To further improve the system, you could consider:

1. Adding more detailed emissions calculations based on vehicle make and model.
2. Implementing a feature to save favorite routes or locations.
3. Adding turn-by-turn navigation instructions for the selected route.
4. Incorporating more environmental factors, such as elevation changes or road types, into the emissions calculations.


Remember to set up your environment variables in a `.env.local` file:

```plaintext
TOMTOM_API_KEY=your_tomtom_api_key
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
```

Replace `your_tomtom_api_key` and `your_openweathermap_api_key` with your actual API keys from TomTom and OpenWeatherMap respectively.

This implementation provides a user-friendly, accessible, and eco-conscious route optimization system that estimates and minimizes vehicle emissions while providing real-time optimal routes with detailed emissions data for each option.
